Animal Identification System

An animal identification expert system is an intensive effort of modern technology to be able to classify, differentiate and identify animals with a good accuracy level. This expert system is a type of program that will be able to handle a limited domain which is this case involves a series of animal characteristics and features at an expert level and using expert knowledge and reasoning process. 
The inspiration behind this system is the fact that many animals have been affected by the intense climate changes and have been migrating away from their birth places which makes it hard for studies to be conducted regarding their species so a very crucial role of such a system is to easily identify the type of animal using a bunch of “if-then” rules and animal characteristics.
This system will emulate a scientist or a researcher to classify animals accurately.
